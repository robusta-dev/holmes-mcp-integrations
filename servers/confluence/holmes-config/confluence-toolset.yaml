      Use the Confluence MCP to search and retrieve documentation from Confluence.

      Available tools:
      - confluence_search: Search for pages using CQL (Confluence Query Language)
      - confluence_get_page: Get page details by ID
      - confluence_get_page_content: Get the full content of a page
      - confluence_get_comments: Get comments on a page

      Search tips:
      - Use CQL syntax: text ~ "search term" to search content
      - Filter by space: space = "MYSPACE"
      - Filter by type: type = "page"
      - Combine filters: space = "DOCS" AND text ~ "kubernetes"

      Example CQL queries:
      - text ~ "deployment guide"
      - space = "ENGINEERING" AND text ~ "architecture"
      - title ~ "runbook*"
      - creator = "user@company.com" AND created >= "2024-01-01"

      When investigating issues:
      1. Search for relevant documentation using confluence_search
      2. Get the full page content with confluence_get_page_content
      3. Check comments for additional context with confluence_get_comments
